    Talk title:
    Self-development for the research software developer

    Abstract:
    The first keynote presentation addresses the structural challenges facing those who create and maintain research software. I will continue in this theme, but pivot to the more personal side of things. Almost by definition, most research software engineers are substantially self-taught, because there really is no standard path in this line of work. It can be hard to organize your own self-development, but it's also extremely rewarding. I'll share some approaches and resources that have been valuable for me over the years. My intent is that the audience will find some affirmation as well as inspiration for charting their own course.
