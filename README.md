Talk for the National Research Software Day By Netherlands eScience Center  
<https://www.esciencecenter.nl/national-research-software-day-2024/>

Talk title:
Self-development for the research software developer
   
Abstract:
The first keynote presentation addresses the structural challenges facing those who create and maintain research software. I will continue in this theme, but pivot to the more personal side of things. Almost by definition, most research software engineers are substantially self-taught, because there really is no standard path in this line of work. It can be hard to organize your own self-development, but it's also extremely rewarding. I'll share some approaches and resources that have been valuable for me over the years. My intent is that the audience will find some affirmation as well as inspiration for charting their own course.

> The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.

> One of the most useful things I’ve learned from hanging out with (much) better programmers: don’t wring hands and speculate. Work a small example that reveals, confirms, or eliminates something.

Presentation of a rather intimidating R message was inspired by a Far Side comic from Gary Larson. You know ... the one about Ginger the dog and "blah blah".

The Far Side very recently got a real online home: <https://www.thefarside.com>. However, last time I checked, this particular comic isn't there (yet). Hopefully it will appear one day and I can link to it.
